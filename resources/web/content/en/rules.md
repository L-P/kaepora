## Streaming your matches

In the same way as the SRL and Racetime races, live streaming your one-on-one OoTR Ladder matches on any stream service is **MANDATORY**.
If you don’t have an account yet and you are planning to join your first OoTR Ladder race, we invite you to create an account.

We strongly recommend to link your Twitch account to your Discord profile so that your stream can be easily accessible for any live review if necessary.

## Before the beginning of your match

When receiving your seed, you’ll have **EXACTLY 15 MINUTES** to prepare your stream setup.
We don’t rely on a system where registered players have to declare themselves ready in order to start the race. **The race begins at the exact time specified in the session detail.** It is assumed that every player is aware of the schedule for each race he/she registers for.

We ask you to be vigilant between the moment your stream goes live and the start of the race. Even if nobody has the knowledge of their opponent’s identity, we do not exclude the fact that some malevolent participants may try to find out this data by themselves by comparing the “Seed Hash” your OoTR ROM has with their own.
*As it stand, there’s no technical way from the ROM itself to hide this hash.*
That’s why we count on you to be extra vigilant.
Here are a few things you can do to protect yourself:

- Add an overlay in order to hide the seed hash in the file selection screen. Don’t forget to disable this overlay when the race starts.
- Stay on the title screen of the game until the beginning of the race.

These measures are taken in order to avoid *as much as possible* any risk of cheating through the viewing of your stream by your opponent.

## During your match

During your match, we expect all participants to follow the rules stated below.

OoTR Ladder races are following the same basic rules as ZSR races. However, with the beta test we’ve had so far, we would like to highlight a few points on which we will be very careful:

- Respect for one's opponent is as obvious as it is indispensable. We will be uncompromising in the event of any disrespect for your opponent or the players in the race.
- Any extra help or spoilers by your Twitch chat regarding your opponent’s identity and the seed you’re playing is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**. You are responsible for your community.
- **We don’t want to see players in voice chat** (Discord, TeamSpeak or any other similar service) with other people, whether they’re in the same session as you or not. We’ve already seen some cases of “meta-gaming” from beta-testers because of the fact people in voice chat decided to mute themselves. That’s something we don’t want to see happen again.

## Generally speaking

We ask you to keep your Twitch VoDs accessible. If you are locking them so that only your subscribers can have access, it is imperative to provide an alternative way to view your past races.

Any `!done` or `!forfeit` is definitive as you will receive both the *spoiler log* for your seed and your opponent name.

To win you need to complete your race, even if your opponent forfeited.
